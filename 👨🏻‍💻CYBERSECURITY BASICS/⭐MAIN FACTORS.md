    # Ensure the roof doesn't leak (Encrypt Data)
    install_waterproof_roof()


# 2. Inspect the House for Weak Spots (Test for Vulnerabilities)

# 3. Keep the House Safe Over Time (Ongoing Security Monitoring)

# The overall process of Application Security

    inspect_house()            # Test for vulnerabilities
